# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure virtual machine from a template with the Azure SDK for Go

This quickstart shows you how to deploy resources from an Azure Resource Manager template, using the Azure SDK for Go. Templates are snapshots of all of the resources within an [Azure resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview). Along the way, you'll become familiar with the functionality and conventions of the SDK.

At the end of this quickstart, you have a running VM that you log into with a username and password.

> [!NOTE]
> To see the creation of a VM in Go without the use of a Resource Manager template, there
> is an [imperative sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples/blob/master/compute/vm.go)
> demonstrating how to build and configure all VM resources with the SDK. Using a template in this sample
> allows a focus on SDK conventions without getting into too many details about Azure service architecture.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you use a local install of the Azure CLI, this quickstart requires CLI version __2.0.28__ or later. Run `az --version` to make sure your CLI install meets this requirement. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install the Azure SDK for Go

[!INCLUDE [azure-sdk-go-get](includes/azure-sdk-go-get.md)]

## Create a service principal

To sign in non-interactively to Azure with an application, you need a service principal. Service principals are part of role-based access control (RBAC), which creates a unique user identity. To create a new service principal with the CLI, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > quickstart.auth
```

Set the environment variable `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` to be the full path to this file. Then the SDK locates and reads the credentials directly from this file, without you having to make any changes or record information from the service principal.

## Get the code

Get the quickstart code and all of its dependencies with `go get`.

```bash
go get -u -d github.com/azure-samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples/quickstarts/deploy-vm/...
```

You don't need to make any source code modifications if the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` variable is properly set. When the program runs, it loads all the necessary authentication information from there.

## Running the code

Run the quickstart with the `go run` command.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/azure-samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples/quickstarts/deploy-vm
go run main.go
```

If the deployment is successful, you see a message giving the username, IP address, and password for logging into the newly created virtual machine. SSH into this machine to see if it's up and running. 

## Cleaning up

Clean up the resources created during this quickstart by deleting the resource group with the CLI.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete -n GoVMQuickstart
```

Also delete the service principal that was created. In the `quickstart.auth` file, there's a JSON key for `clientId`. Copy this value to the `CLIENT_ID_VALUE` environment
variable and run the following Azure CLI command:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp delete --id ${CLIENT_ID_VALUE}
```

Where you supply the value for `CLIENT_ID_VALUE` from `quickstart.auth`.

> [!WARNING]
> Failing to delete the service principal for this application leaves it active in your Azure Active Directory tenant.
> While both the name and password for the service principal are generated as UUIDs, make sure that you follow
> good security practices by deleting any unused service principals and Azure Active Directory Applications.

## Code in depth

What the quickstart code does is broken down into a block of variables and several small functions, each of which are discussed here.

### Variables, constants, and types

Since quickstart is self-contained, it uses global constants and variables.

```go
const (
    resourceGroupName     = "GoVMQuickstart"
    resourceGroupLocation = "eastus"

    deploymentName = "VMDeployQuickstart"
    templateFile   = "vm-quickstart-template.json"
    parametersFile = "vm-quickstart-params.json"
)

// Information loaded from the authorization file to identify the client
type clientInfo struct {
    SubscriptionID string
    VMPassword     string
}

var (
    ctx        = context.Background()
    clientData clientInfo
    authorizer autorest.Authorizer
)
```

Values are declared which give the names of created resources. The location is also specified here, which you can change to see how deployments behave in other datacenters. Not every datacenter has all of the required resources available.

The `clientInfo` type holds the information loaded from the authentication file to set up clients in the SDK and set the VM password.

The `templateFile` and `parametersFile` constants point to the files needed for deployment. The `authorizer` will be configured by the Go SDK for authentication, and the `ctx` variable is a [Go context](https://blog.golang.org/context) for the network operations.

### Authentication and initialization

The `init` function sets up authentication. Since authentication is a precondition for everything in the quickstart, it makes sense to have it as part of initialization. It also loads some information needed from the authentication file to configure clients and the VM.

```go
func init() {
    var err error
    authorizer, err = auth.NewAuthorizerFromFile(azure.PublicCloud.ResourceManagerEndpoint)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get OAuth config: %v", err)
    }

    authInfo, err := readJSON(os.Getenv("AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION"))
    clientData.SubscriptionID = (*authInfo)["subscriptionId"].(string)
    clientData.VMPassword = (*authInfo)["clientSecret"].(string)
}
```

First, [auth.NewAuthorizerFromFile](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure/auth#NewAuthorizerFromFile) is called to load the authentication information from the file located at `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION`. Next, this file is loaded manually by the `readJSON` function (omitted here) to pull the two values needed to run the rest of the program: The subscription ID of the client, and the service principal's secret, which is also used for the VM's password.

> [!WARNING]
> To keep the quickstart simple, the service principal password is reused. In production, take care to __never__ reuse a password which gives access to your Azure resources.

### Flow of operations in main()

The `main` function is simple, only indicating the flow of operations and performing error-checking.

```go
func main() {
    group, err := createGroup()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to create group: %v", err)
    }
    log.Printf("Created group: %v", *group.Name)

    log.Printf("Starting deployment: %s", deploymentName)
    result, err := createDeployment()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to deploy: %v", err)
    }
    if result.Name != nil {
        log.Printf("Completed deployment %v: %v", deploymentName, *result.Properties.ProvisioningState)
    } else {
        log.Printf("Completed deployment %v (no data returned to SDK)", deploymentName)
    }
    getLogin()
}
```

The steps that the code runs through are, in order:

* Create the resource group to deploy to (`createGroup`)
* Create the deployment within this group (`createDeployment`)
* Get and display login information for the deployed VM (`getLogin`)

### Create the resource group

The `createGroup` function creates the resource group. Looking at the call flow and arguments demonstrates the way that service interactions are structured in the SDK.

```go
func createGroup() (group resources.Group, err error) {
    groupsClient := resources.NewGroupsClient(clientData.SubscriptionID)
    groupsClient.Authorizer = authorizer

        return groupsClient.CreateOrUpdate(
                ctx,
                resourceGroupName,
                resources.Group{
                        Location: to.StringPtr(resourceGroupLocation)})
}
```

The general flow of interacting with an Azure service is:

* Create the client using the `service.New*Client()` method, where `*` is the resource type of the `service` that you want to interact with. This function always takes a subscription ID.
* Set the authorization method for the client, allowing it to interact with the remote API.
* Make the method call on the client corresponding to the remote API. Service client methods usually take the name of the resource and a metadata object.

The [`to.StringPtr`](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/to#StringPtr) function is used to perform a type conversion here. The parameters for SDK methods almost exclusively take pointers, so convenience methods are provided to make the type conversions easy. See the documentation for the [autorest/to](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/to) module for the complete list of convenience converters and their behavior.

The `groupsClient.CreateOrUpdate` method returns a pointer to a data type representing the resource group. A direct return value of this kind indicates a short-running operation that is meant to be synchronous. In the next section, you'll see an example of a long-running operation and how to interact with it.

### Perform the deployment

Once the resource group is created, it's time to run the deployment. This code is broken up into smaller sections to emphasize different parts of its logic.

```go
func createDeployment() (deployment resources.DeploymentExtended, err error) {
    template, err := readJSON(templateFile)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    params, err := readJSON(parametersFile)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    (*params)["vm_password"] = map[string]string{
        "value": clientData.VMPassword,
    }
        // ...
```

The deployment files are loaded by `readJSON`, the details of which are skipped here. This function returns a `*map[string]interface{}`, the type used in
constructing the metadata for the resource deployment call. The VM's password is also set manually on the deployment parameters.

```go
        // ...

    deploymentsClient := resources.NewDeploymentsClient(clientData.SubscriptionID)
    deploymentsClient.Authorizer = authorizer

    deploymentFuture, err := deploymentsClient.CreateOrUpdate(
        ctx,
        resourceGroupName,
        deploymentName,
        resources.Deployment{
            Properties: &resources.DeploymentProperties{
                Template:   template,
                Parameters: params,
                Mode:       resources.Incremental,
            },
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
```

This code follows the same pattern as creating the resource group. A new client is created, given the ability to authenticate with Azure, and then a method is called.
The method even has the same name (`CreateOrUpdate`) as the corresponding method for resource groups. This pattern is seen throughout the SDK.
Methods that perform similar work normally have the same name.

The biggest difference comes in the return value of the `deploymentsClient.CreateOrUpdate` method. This value is of the [Future](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure#Future) type, which follows the [future design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises). Futures represent a long-running operation in Azure that you can poll, cancel, or block on their completion.

```go
        //...
    err = deploymentFuture.Future.WaitForCompletion(ctx, deploymentsClient.BaseClient.Client)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    return deploymentFuture.Result(deploymentsClient)
}
```

For this example, the best thing to do is to wait for the operation to complete. Waiting on a future requires both a [context object](https://blog.golang.org/context) and the client that created
the `Future`. There are two possible error sources here: An error caused on the client side when trying to invoke the method, and an error response from the server. The latter is returned as
part of the `deploymentFuture.Result` call.

### Get the assigned IP address

To do anything with the newly created VM, you need the assigned IP address. IP addresses are their own separate Azure resource, bound to Network Interface Controller (NIC) resources.

```go
func getLogin() {
    params, err := readJSON(parametersFile)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Unable to read parameters. Get login information with `az network public-ip list -g %s", resourceGroupName)
    }

    addressClient := network.NewPublicIPAddressesClient(clientData.SubscriptionID)
    addressClient.Authorizer = authorizer
    ipName := (*params)["publicIPAddresses_QuickstartVM_ip_name"].(map[string]interface{})
    ipAddress, err := addressClient.Get(ctx, resourceGroupName, ipName["value"].(string), "")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Unable to get IP information. Try using `az network public-ip list -g %s", resourceGroupName)
    }

    vmUser := (*params)["vm_user"].(map[string]interface{})

    log.Printf("Log in with ssh: %s@%s, password: %s",
        vmUser["value"].(string),
        *ipAddress.PublicIPAddressPropertiesFormat.IPAddress,
        clientData.VMPassword)
}
```

This method relies on information that is stored in the parameters file. The code could query the VM directly to get its NIC, query the NIC to get its IP resource, and then query the IP resource directly. That's a long chain of dependencies and operations to resolve, making it expensive. Since the JSON information is local, it can be loaded instead.

The value for the VM user is also loaded from the JSON. The VM password was loaded earlier from the authentication file.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you took an existing template and deployed it through Go. Then you connected to the newly created VM via SSH.
